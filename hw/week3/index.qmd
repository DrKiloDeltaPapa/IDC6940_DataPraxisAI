#### Background/Motivation:

-   **Describe the context in which the research was conducted.**

    The research conducted by Realinho et al. (2022) is framed in the higher education setting, specifically, issues with students dropping out and the lack of academic success. According to Realinho et al. (2022) student attrition and academic failure does not only negatively affect the education institutions that students attend, but they create greater adverse societal issues. For example, when students drop out prior to completing a degree program it makes them less competitive concerning the job market, which then leads to economic dificiencies, which can lead to inadequate health care access and subsequent more dire socio-economic issues that often disproportionally affect marginalized demographics (Realinho et al., 2022). 

-   **What problem or gap in the existing literature does the paper aim to address?**

    Concerning the problem or gap in the existing literature on students dropping out of institutes of higher learning prior to completing their degrees Realinho et al. (2022) assert that there is no universal measure of "student dropout". Researchers who are produce work on higher education student attrition often have differing measures drop out, and most mesaure the phenomena at the macro level, which then creates issues concerning research comparison and understanding the nuances of the phenomena at a micro level (Realinho et al., 2022). To address the issue of disparate measures of student dropout and to better understand the features that contribute to it Realinho et al. (2022) proposed taking a micro perspective in that changes to student degree projection would be looked at regardless of time of occurence. Further, Realinho et al. (2022) compiled a unique data set that comprised of varied source data which they then used to train machine learning classifiers that predict student drop out and academic success.

-   **Discuss the significance of the research question and why it is important.**
      
    Realinho et al. (2022) asks, "What are the key factors that lead to student dropout?" Posed in a higher education setting this question is significant to all educational environments to include K-12 as many of factors are interchangeable. Further the issue of predicting the root causes of stundent attrition and then using model results to directly drive changes to pedagogy or intervention is not typically explored (Realinho et al., 2022).
